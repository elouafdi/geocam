#summary How to set up the build path on your instance of Eclipse.

= Introduction =

When you first download a developer's version of our code, you need to explain to eclipse how to compile the code into a working program. In addition to our source code, there are some libraries that you'll need to install.

= What libraries do we use, exactly? =

In the interest of producing a reasonable-sized final executable, we should only include libraries that we actually need to use. Below are the libraries you will need to incorporate into the build path, and a list of what they do.
  * Xerces / XML-APIs : These read our XML formatted data files.
  * jReality : Our main graphics library.
  * lwjgl : The "lightweight java game library" is used to read input from a game pad.
  * jinput.jar : See lwjgl. (?)
  * gluegen : I have the impression that this lets library allows java code to call into C/C++ code, which is necessary for a graphics library like JReality/JOGL.
  * JOGL : The graphics library that jreality uses for lower-level rendering work.
