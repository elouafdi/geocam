#summary This page describes how we plan to distribute our program.

= Introduction =

One of our goals this summer is to produce some executables that non-programmers can download and run. In particular, we want to be able to distribute the  "Development 2D" portion of the project, which has some graphical dependencies. 

At the risk of stating the obvious, a user-friendly application is more than just an executable or .jar file. It contains at least the following data:
  # A file telling the OS how to launch the application.
  # An icon (My impression is that the great majority of users only know how to launch applications by clicking on icons.)
  # The executable itself (a .jar file, for instance).
  # Any system-specific libraries the program needs.
  # A collection of data files, including:
      * Textures and 3D models (for the insects, markers, etc.)
      * Manifolds
  # A plan for storing all of this material somewhere on the user's machine.

The purpose of this page is to describe:
  # Where the data above resides within our project
  # How to package our project for distribution
  # What tools help with the previous item, and how to use them

== Here be Dragons ==

Last summer we made at least two attempts at packaging the project and failed both times. Below are some problems we ran into:
  # Applications are organized differently on each OS.
     * Ex: On windows, most users are reasonably comfortable with .exe files (which can bundle together some of the items listed above). On Mac OSX, .app files are the norm, etc.)
