#Fixes to make when downloading/updating the project on Mac

= Download/Update Issues for Mac OSX =

When downloading for the first time, need to add jreality project and some JARs to project's build path:

Geocam => Configure build path
  * Add jreality folder to projects
  * Add to libraries jogl.jar (from jreality), lwjgl.jar (from lwjgl folder), and xercesImpl.jar, xercesSamples.jar, and xml-apis.jar (from xerces folder).
  * Change native library of jreality project to macosx
  * Change native library of lwjgl.jar to macosx

How to change the native libraries:

 For jreality:
  * Geocam => Configure build path => Projects
  * Click on arrow next to jreality folder
  * Double click on Native library location
  * In workspace folder, locate jreality => jni => macosx
 For lwgjl:
  * Geocam => Configure build path => Libraries
  * Click arrow next to lwjgl.jar
  * Double click on Native library location
  * In workspace folder, locate lwjgl => native => macosx
