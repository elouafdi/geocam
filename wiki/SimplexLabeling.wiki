#This module describes how to use the procedures in the miscmath module to obtain labelings of portions of a triangulation.

= Description =

To perform a calculation on a triangulation, one invariably has to inspect the topology of that triangulation. Such an inspection often involves examining all the simplices associated with a particular region of the triangulation, and examining how they are connected to each other. For example, given a face, we might like to know the edges and vertices of that face, how they are positioned with respect to each other on the face. This module provides a convenient way to address these questions.

= Procedure Definitions =
  * `StdEdge labelEdge(Edge& e, Vertex& v)`
  * `StdFace labelFace(Face& f, Vertex& v)`
  * `StdFace labelFace(Face& f, Edge& e)`
  * `StdTetra labelTetra(Tetra& t, Edge& e)`
  * `StdTetra labelTetra(Tetra& t, Vertex& v)`
  * `StdTetra labelTetra(Tetra& t, Face& f)`
  * `StdTetra labelTetra(Tetra& t)`

In each procedure


Currently, we describe a labeling as a `struct` of integers. For example, below is the definition for a labeled face:
{{{
struct stand_psn_face{
int v1;
int v2;
int v3;

int e12;
int e13;
int e23;
};
typedef stand_psn_face StdFace;
}}}
The other structure are analogous.
