#summary Summer 2012 To Do List.


= To Do =

  * "Model" Tasks:
    * <strike> Mobius strip from .off </strike>
    * ||Immersed Klein bottle .off|| ??? ||
    * ||Surfaces with more genus .off files|| ???||
    * ||Set up marker models and surface models to use a consistent scale||
           That is to say, if the scales are consistent across our data files, we should never load an ant and a surface and find the ant is enormous in comparison to the surface. The easiest thing to do would be to start with the data we know we'll use in the museum exhibit (the ant model and some simple .off's), using blender 2.49 to rescale the data and export the .offs. We will still have an "object rescaling" slider, so the scales don't have to be perfect, they should just look reasonable by default.

  * "View" Tasks:
    * ||1st person embedded view|| ???||
      * Tie the embedded view to the perspective of the viewer
    * || Overlay the map (2D View)|| ??? ||
      * Place a black cutout over the view so that we do not see the boundary of the development.

  * "Picture" Tasks: 
    * || Color scheme with patterns || ???||
      * Allow patterns in the faces, not just colors.


  * "Controller" Tasks:
    * ||New controller|| ???||
      * Probably nintendo controller?

  * "Animation" Tasks:
    * ||Animation of changing perspective|| ??? ||
      * Fly the camera from far away to the first person embedded view.
    * || Animation for unfolding || ??? ||
      * Show unfolding from embedded view to first person


  * "Software Engineering" Tasks:
    * ||Release version 0.1|| ???||
      * This will have a limited choice of manifolds.

  * Bugs
    * ||<strike>Fix bugs for non-embedded stuff</strike>|| Staci/Taylor ||

  * Dynamics
    * Allow (live) changing geometry
      * || Changing radii tori|| ??? ||
      * || Combinatorial Ricci flow|| ??? ||

  * Pie in the Sky Tasks:
    * || Multi-player games|| ??? ||
    * ||Android pad functionality|| ??? ||
    * ||VR goggles functionality||??? ||
    * ||Exotic controller functionality|| ??? ||
      * Kinect?

  * From related projects:
    * ||xml functionality for geoquantViewer runnable jar|| ??? ||
      * It will not read this right now.
