\subsection*{Introduction}

\begin{quotation}
The \texttt{printResultsVertex} function prints out the results of a
curvature flow, with the results grouped by each vertex of the
triangulation. These results will be written to the file given by \texttt{%
filename}.
\end{quotation}

\subsection*{Description}

\begin{quotation}
Prints the results of a curvature flow into the file given by \texttt{%
filename}. The results, that is, the radii and curvature values, are given
by vectors of doubles. Most commonly, these vectors are taken from the
Approximator class after the flow is run. The \texttt{printResultsVertex}
function determines the number of vertices of the current triangulation and
the total number of steps are then derived from this and the size of the
vectors.

There are several ways to display the results. The \texttt{printResultsVertex%
} function groups by vertex. This means that for each vertex of the
triangulation, the radii and curvature values for each step is given. An
example is shown below. Other formats are given by printResultsStep,
printResultsNum, print3DResultsStep.

{\small 
  printResultsVertex("./ODEResults.txt", app->radiiHistory, app->curvHistory);
}

\subsection*{Limitations}

\begin{quotation}
Currently the \texttt{printResultsVertex} function is limited in the
information it prints. As our curvature flow has evolved to record
additional information such as volumes, it may be time to explore a more
robust form for displaying results. As there is considerable dependence on
the Approximator for the data vectors, it may be wise to place this and
similar functions in the Approximator class.
\end{quotation}

\subsection*{Revisions}

\begin{itemize}
\item subversion 545, 9/29/08: Moved the printing of results out of calcFlow
and into a new function.

\item subversion 783, 6/18/09: Small modifications in response to changes in
the Approximator class.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Testing}

\begin{quotation}
The \texttt{printResultsVertex} function was tested by running multiple
curvature flows and printing the results. It was considered working when the
format of the data was as desired.
\end{quotation}

\subsection*{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
\item 6/29 - Recreate the print functions to print more data and be more
flexible.

\item 6/29 - Move the print functions into the Approximator class.
\end{itemize}
