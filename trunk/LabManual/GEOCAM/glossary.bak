\begin{description}
\item[circle power] Given a circle $C$ and a point $P$, let $L$ be the line
through the point $P$ that passes through the center of the circle. \ The $A$
and $B$ be the intersection points of the $L$ with the circle. \ Define a
signed distance $\left\Vert \overline{PX}\right\Vert $ for a line segment $%
\overline{PX}$ to be negative if the line segment lies entirely within the
circle, and positive otherwise. \ The \textit{circle power} of $P$ relative
to $C$, denoted by $pow_{C}\left( P\right) $, is given by:%
\begin{equation*}
pow_{C}\left( P\right) =\left\Vert \overline{PA}\right\Vert \left\Vert 
\overline{PB}\right\Vert .
\end{equation*}%
Alternatively, if $C$ is defined implicitly by $\left( x-x_{c}\right)
^{2}+\left( y-y_{c}\right) ^{2}=r_{c}^{2}$, then the circle power can be
expressed as:%
\begin{equation*}
pow_{C}\left( P\right) =\left( x-x_{c}\right) ^{2}+\left( y-y_{c}\right)
^{2}-r_{c}^{2}.
\end{equation*}

\item[common power point] The point of the plane (or $%

^{3}$) containing a decorated triangle (or tetrahedron) that has the same
circle power with respect to each of the weight circles. \ 

\item[decorated simplex (edge, triangle, tetrahedron,...)] A simplex is
called \textit{decorated} when weights are assigned to the vertices of the
simplex and then actualized by embedding the simplex into Euclidean space
together with spheres centered at the vertices with radii determined by the
weights. \ The orthocircle (if one exists) is sometimes considered part of
the decorated simplex when appropriate.

\item[edge curvature] Given a three-dimensional piecewise flat manifold $%
\left( M,\mathcal{T},d\right) $, the \textit{edge curvature} along an edge $%
\left\{ i,j\right\} $, measures how much that edge differs from Euclidean
space. \ Specifically, the edge curvature $K_{ij}$ is given by 
\begin{equation*}
K_{ij}=\left( 2\pi -\sum\limits_{\substack{ k,l\text{, such that} \\ \left\{
i,j,k,l\right\} \in \mathcal{T}}}\beta _{ij,kl}\right) l_{ij},
\end{equation*}%
where $l_{ij}$ is the edge length, and $\beta _{ij,kl}$ is the dihedral
angle of the edge $\left\{ i,j\right\} $ of the tetrahedron $\left\{
i,j,k,l\right\} $. \ In a triangulation of three-dimensional Euclidean space 
$K_{ij}=0$ for all edges. \ 

\item[Einstein constant] For a piecewise flat manifold $\left( M,\mathcal{T}%
,d\right) $, the \textit{Einstein constant} $\lambda $ is given by%
\begin{equation*}
\lambda =\frac{EHR\left( M,\mathcal{T},d\right) }{3\mathcal{V}},
\end{equation*}%
where $EHR\left( M,\mathcal{T},d\right) $ is the Einstein-Hilbert-Regge
functional and $\mathcal{V}$ is the total volume.

\item[Einstein metric] Given a piecewise flat manifold $\left( M,\mathcal{T}%
,d\right) $, we say that $d$ is an \textit{Einstein metric} provided that
for all edges $\left\{ i,j\right\} $ in the triangulation we have:%
\begin{equation*}
K_{ij}=\lambda l_{ij}\frac{\partial \mathcal{V}}{\partial l_{ij}},
\end{equation*}%
where $K_{ij}$ is the edge curvature, $l_{ij}$ is the edge length, $\mathcal{%
V}$ is the total volume, and $\lambda $ is the Einstein constant.

\item[inversive distance] Start with a decorated edge $e_{ij}$, that is, an
edge of length $l_{ij}$ with weight circles of radius $r_{i},r_{j}$ centered
on its vertices. \ The inversive distance $\eta _{ij}$ of the edge $e_{ij}$
can be calculated with the formula:%
\begin{equation*}
\eta _{ij}=\frac{l_{ij}^{2}-r_{i}^{2}-r_{j}^{2}}{2r_{i}r_{j}}.
\end{equation*}%
When the two weight circles intersect with angle $\theta _{ij}$, we have the
simple formula:%
\begin{equation*}
\eta _{ij}=\cos \left( \theta _{ij}\right) .
\end{equation*}%
The former formula was obtained by using the law of cosines and solving for
the $\cos \left( \theta _{ij}\right) $ term. \ When the weight circle do not
intersect and do not contain one or the other $\eta _{ij}>1$. \ When the
weight circles intersect at some angle then $1\geq \eta _{ij}\geq -1$. \ If
one weight circle contains the other we have $\eta _{ij}<1$. \ 

\item[manifold] A second countable Hausdorff topological space $M$ is a 
\textit{manifold} provided there is an integer $n>0$ such that for each $%
x\in M$ there is an open set $U_{x}$ containing $x$ and a homeomorphism $%
h_{x}:U_{x}\rightarrow B\left( 1,0\right) \subset

^{n}$.

\item[orthocircle] Given a decorated triangle, provided the common power
point is outside all of the weight circles, there exists a circle that is
orthogonal to each of the weight circles. \ That is, the \textit{orthocircle}
is the circle that intersects each of the weight circles orthogonally. \ The
orthocircle does not exist when the common power point is on or inside all
three circles, however if the common power point is at infinity, there is a
line that is orthogonal to the three weight circles which will also be
identified as the orthocircle.

\item[piecewise flat manifold] A triple $\left( M,\mathcal{T},d\right) $
where $\left( M,\mathcal{T}\right) $ is a compact triangulated manifold with
triangulation $\mathcal{T}$, $d$ is a metric on $M$ so that the restriction
of $d$ to each simplex of $\mathcal{T}$ is isometric to a Euclidean simplex
of the same dimension. \ 

\item[triangulation] A collection of $n$-dimensional simplices $\mathcal{T}$
together with pairwise identifications for the $\left( n-1\right) $%
-dimensional faces of the simplices. \ More restrictions are needed to
ensure that the resultant space is a manifold. \ Alternatively, given a
space $M$ of dimension $n$, a \textit{triangulation} of $M$ is a subdivision
of $M$ into components $\left\{ \sigma _{i}\right\} $ by (hyper)surfaces (of
dimension $n-1$) so that each component is homeomorphic to an $n$%
-dimensional ball, and each component is combinatorially (as determined by
the subdivisions) equivalent to an $n$-simplex. \
